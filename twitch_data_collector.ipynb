    "# Twitch Insight: Data Collector & Collaboration Network Analyzer (v3 - Enhanced Prints)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook automates the process of collecting data from the Twitch API, store it in a local SQLite database, and perform analysis, with a special focus on understanding collaboration networks between streamers. It identifies potential collaborations by detecting `@mentions` in video titles and descriptions, and also explores community structures within these networks. The primary interface for data collection, processing, and exploration is a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Fetches top streams/categories periodically.\n",
    "- Fetches channel details and video archives.\n",
    "- Processes video titles/descriptions for `@mentions`.\n",
    "- Looks up mentioned users via API if not in the database.\n",
    "- Stores collaboration data (frequency, duration, recency).\n",
    "- Processes mentions atomically per-video using DB transactions.\n",
    "- Includes a refresh cycle for updating random channels.\n",
    "- Provides data exploration for channels, videos, and the collaboration network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules Used:**\n",
    "- `config.py`: Configuration (API keys, constants). Requires `.env` file.\n",
    "- `database.py`: SQLite database interactions (schema, CRUD, upserts).\n",
    "- `twitch_api.py`: Twitch Helix API communication (auth, rate limits).\n",
    "- `network_utils.py`: Mention extraction and validation."
